 **WARNING: Please, read this note carefully before submitting a new issue:**

It is important to realise that **this is NOT A SUPPORT FORUM**, this is for reproducible BUGS with raylib ONLY.

There are lots of generous and helpful people ready to help you out on [raylib Discord forum](https://discord.gg/raylib) or [raylib reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raylib/).

Remember that asking for support questions here actively takes developer time away from improving raylib.
